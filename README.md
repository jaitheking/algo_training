# Algorithms training with C# (Net 5.0)

These are the code I used to practice some algorithms and revise some basic algorithms for problems.
You can refer to these if you are interested to see we can solve these usual problems using C#.

Problems solved so far:
1. Fibonacci Sequence
2. Grid Traveller Problem (Down or Right movements only)
