# Algorithms training with C# (Net 5.0)

These are the code I used to practice some algorithms and revise some basic algorithms for problems.  
You can refer to these if you are interested to see we can solve these usual problems using C#.  

<br>

## Problems solved so far:
1. **Fibonacci Sequence** - Get Fibonacci number by passing an index of the sequence 
2. **Grid Traveller Problem** - Based on moving from the start position in a grid to an end where you can only move with down or right movements only.
3. **Can Sum Problem** - When provided with a target sum value and an array of numbers, we need to check if the array can sum up to get the target sum value.
4. **How Sum Problem** - When provided with a target sum value and an array of numbers, we need to get at least 1 combination of numbers from the array that can sum up to get the target sum value.
5. **Best Sum Problem** - When provided with a target sum value and an array of numbers, we need to find the shortest combination of numbers to get the target sum value.  
6. **Can Construct** - A target word is provided along with an array of words, also refers as the word bank. We need to find out if the word bank array can form the given target word.
7. **Count Construct** - A target word is provided along with a word bank. We need to count the number of combinations using the word bank given to form the target word.
8. **All Construct** - This problem is about identifying all possible combinations to form a target word with a given word bank.

## Common Rules of Algorithm solving:
1. Before diving to the coding part, it is best to identify **base cases**.
2. Focus on **correctness** before looking for the most efficient way to solve a problem.
3. Look out for **common patterns** in a problem and you may to use an example with modest amount of cases to find the patterns.
4. Some **tradeoffs** are by increasing the space complexity to reduce time complexity. Hence, we need to be observant on such differences when optimizing.
